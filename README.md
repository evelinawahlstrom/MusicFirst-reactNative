 #  :iphone: MusicFirst - a React Native Mobile App :iphone:
 
## What this project is about:

Hackaton challenge showcasing my ability to learn something new in 2,5 days during my time at Codaisseur. Final week of the bootcamp. This is the client. See related repository for the server.

Rules: 
- You have 3 days to make the most awesome app
- You have to use some new technology you have not tried
- You have to incorporate the theme of this hackaton: 

Theme (randomly selected): :money_with_wings:

## Project description

I choose to use React Native to build a a music festival app that makes payment easy for the attendees.
<br/> My idea come from the many festivals I've attended where the payment is always tricky. During a festival you want to focus on what's important - the music, that's why this app **MusicFirst** was built to enable a modern festival. 

- It should be easy to pay with your phone and then add who you’re paying for by adding that persons name to the order. The idea is then that the person will get an “invoice” to their profile page. 
- I've decided to use PayPal as it's an international payment system
